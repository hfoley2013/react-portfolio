      "description": "üëã My name is Harper Foley and I am a software developer with a background in finance and Navy Special Operations. I spent eight years leading elite teams of bomb technicians across the globe in extremely fast-paced and ambiguous environments with a 100% mission success rate. After transitioning from the military in 2021, I broke into investment banking as a financial analyst specializing in Tech M&A and advised on 10 projects valued at ~$3.5 billion. I decided to move into software development because after learning some basic VBA and Python coding to eliminate a series of manual processes at work, I realized that I really enjoyed designing software programs and loved being the creator of tools that solved real world problems. I am currently working on a project, Rainier Racing Co., to build the ‚ÄúRobinhood‚Äù of Play-To-Earn Gaming that gives Web3 gamers access to the financial market data they need to make informed purchases of gaming NFTs. You should bring me onboard because I can uniquely bridge the gap between your product, engineering, and business teams by leveraging my leadership, finance, and coding experience to help build amazing products that your customers will love.",
